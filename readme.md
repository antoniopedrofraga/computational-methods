## Description 

Four numerical schemes were applied to compute a solution for a
parabolic partial differential equation, the heat conduction equation.
Two different types of schemes were used, explicit and implicit, and
their solutions were evaluated. It could be observed the different
behaviours of unstable and stable schemes. Step size variations of a
stable method were studied as well. The obtained solutions were compared
to the problem analytical solution in order to have a better
understanding on these different behaviours.
